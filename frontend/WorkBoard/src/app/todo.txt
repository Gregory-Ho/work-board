Mar 16:
  Finished Nav bar mostly. It"s fully responsive now.
  Added colours and border rounding. Not sure if  you want rounded borders for
  the full size version side bar, for active status.
  * Need to implement active flag to indicate which link should be highlighted
  * Need to find suitable colours. We can remove the bg-light from bootstrap nav.
  * Refactor the CSS?
  * Do we want to add a background color to the side bar?
